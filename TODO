App Setup Steps: 
  ☐ Start a new rails app
  ☐ Start a spec suite with the situations described below
  ☐ Add the base JSON file supplied from the team

Growing in Tandem with Caretaker Chris (they/them):
  ☐ Needs to know which plants must be watered
  ☐ On a date they have selected
  
They want a README:
  ☐ With information on how to run the code
  ☐ With details about known issues to look out for
  ☐ With details about known complexities to look out for
  ☐ With details about the Roadmap for this project

Caretaker Chris starts the app:
  ☐ It should load successfully
  ☐ It should let Caretaker Chris know when it's ready to accept input
  ☐ It should gracefully handle any exceptions thrown by making it human-readable
  ☐ It should let Caretaker Chris select a date to look at

When the app is loading:
  ☐ It should look for a file named `Apprentice_WeGrowInTandem_Data.json` in our present working directory
    ☐ With success, it should read the contents of the file 
    ☐ With failure, it should elevate the exception to Caretaker Chris

It should determine the next 12 weeks' scheduling:
    ☐ Excluding Sundays or Saturdays as watering days
    ☐ Using the start_date (Monday, Dec 16th 2019)
    ☐ Ending at the end_date (Sunday, March 15th 2019)

When the app is finished loading:
  ☐ It should prompt Caretaker Chris to select a date
  ☐ It would be nice to render the current day by default

Caretaker Chris selects a date:
  ☐ It should display the plants that need to be watered
  ☐ It should limit them to the 12 week schedule
